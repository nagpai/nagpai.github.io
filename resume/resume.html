        <h2>Objective</h2>
        
        <p>I am curious and excited towards an engineering / developer role where I get to be a part of a team that builds and maintains our products. I have always been inspired and fascinated by the work of our developer colleagues. After learning a few basics about programming, I am hoping to learn more from them and join their ranks. After 5 years as a successful Happiness Engineer, I look forward to this as my next challenge for growing within Automattic.</p>

This was a one-line small change, that came out of a bug report discussion I was checking. I sought guidance from another experienced developer colleague. The solution was found by them (internal link can be shared on request). They encouraged me (or anyone else) to submit a patch.
