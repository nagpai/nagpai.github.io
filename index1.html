    <h2>Aspiring Developer</h2>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>After contributing to Automattic as a Happiness Engineer for 5 years, I am curious to upskill myself towards an engineering / development role where I get to build and maintain our products. I have always been inspired and fascinated by how developer colleagues manage the heart and soul of our products. I am hoping to learn from them and join their ranks, contributing to our products and open source in a different way! </p>
