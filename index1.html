    <h2>Aspiring Developer</h2>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Working as a Happiness Engineer for 5 years has made me curious to groom myself towards building and maintaining our products. I have familiarized myself with the basics of JavaScript, PHP and Git. I have yet to scale up to have full comfort with frameworks like react, and have very basic familiarity with NPM and how it is used to manage dependencies.</p>
